# Change Log

All notable changes to the marker locations will be documented in this file.


## V1.2 (2023-12-09)

Cross referenced and made adjustments to 180 calculated NSW positions.

## V1.1 (2023-12-06)
 
Changes to the Murray River locations, including:
* 56 additional GPS confirmed locations 
* 6 significantly changed GPS confirmed locations
* 46 alpine markers plus another 4 seen on the Swampy Plain River
* 140 additional markers above the last known alpine marker to the source.

New chainages have been done on most of the calculated locations to provide more 
accurate distances between known locations, including calculated markers between
the river mouth and first physical marker at KM 72.

### GPS confirmed locations that have been significantly changed

The following locations were moved more than 250m from v1.0, with the
distances calculated using the Haversine formula.

- 104: Moved to correct side (253 m)
- 918: Invalid location (490 m)
- 1012: Vandalised sign that has been potentially moved (362 m)
- 1092: Invalid location (987 m)
- 1114: Invalid location (536 m)
- 1146: Invalid location (292 m)

Note that those listed with Invalid location were most likely due to
data entry errors.

### GPS confirmed locations removed

None, however a large number were not seen on a post flood trip and may reflect
a large loss of signs along the river. See the **Notes** section.

### Notes

A large number of GPS confirmed locations were not seen since the 2022/23 flood,
but no attempt to do an accurate post-flood survey has been done.
